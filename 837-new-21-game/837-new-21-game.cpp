// We store the probability of every state, i.e. probability of getting 2, 3, etc at any point- in our dp vector. Realise that play will stop at k, so atmax the player will draw is (k-1) + maxPts, so we are guaranteed to get anything <= k-1-maxPts. We start with zero points so probability of ending up with 0 points also = 1. After checking k, we set dp[0] = 1 (for same reason as stated).
// Now comes the tricky part, we iterate for i=0 to n and in each iteration update the dp[i+1] (hence go until <n, as we need to update upto dp[n].
// In each iteration, check if 'i' is <k, if it is add its value in sum and calcuate dp[i+1] = sum/maxPts.
// This is done because we are checking how many ways are present to reach that state. For example:
// f(1)- only one possible way- from f(0) draw card=1
// f(2)- two ways, either draw card=2 from f(0) or draw card=1 from f(1)
// hence we keep adding the dp[i] and atlast divide it with maxPts as we can only draw card between range [1, maxPts].
// Now, if i>=maxPts, we need to subtract dp[i-maxPts] from it- take this example, we have maxPts=5, hence we can draw any card [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with equal probability. Now if we need to calculate f(7)
// f(7) = f(6) (after this draw 1) + f(5) (after this draw 2)+ f(4) (after this draw 3)+ f(3) (after this draw 4)+ f(2) (after this draw 5), no other states possible that can reach f(7) in 1 step. Hence, if our current sum contains value of dp[1] (f(1)), that needs to subtracted from sum.
// Atlast, add all the probabilities of states that are possible stopping values, i.e. we can stop at k, k+1, or anything else upto n (remember we checked n>=k-1+maxPts at the start). Now the summation of this probabilities will be our answer.
